# Project 1: ["Zomato Data Analysis: Uncovering Patterns in Customer Ordering"])(https://github.com/vishal4-art/vishal4-art/blob/08aa3f0bdd449622b1a8a6d39719df6ec77d7ff6/zomato_project11.ipynb)
Zomato Customer Order Analysis Project Overview
Objective:
The project aims to analyze Zomato customer order data to uncover key trends, customer preferences, and patterns that can help enhance business decision-making and customer satisfaction.

Key Components:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Acquired the Zomato dataset containing customer orders, including details such as order IDs, customer demographics, food categories, pricing, and ratings.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues for consistency and accuracy.
Data Analysis Techniques:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python to identify significant trends, such as:
Most popular food categories and restaurants.
Peak ordering times and regions with the highest demand.
Customer behavior patterns, including preferences and spending habits.
Extracted insights using SQL queries for specific data aggregations, filtering, and relational analysis.
Data Visualization:

Created interactive dashboards using Power BI/Tableau to present findings.
Visualized key metrics, such as sales trends, customer segmentation, and top-performing regions/restaurants.
Outcomes and Recommendations:

Identified actionable insights, such as strategies to improve delivery efficiency or optimize marketing for high-demand food categories.
Suggested data-driven approaches for enhancing customer experience and boosting profitability.
Skills and Tools Used:
Programming: Python, SQL
Visualization: Power BI/Tableau
Techniques: EDA, Data Cleaning, Reporting
Impact:
This project demonstrates the practical application of data science and analytics to real-world business challenges, showcasing expertise in handling data, generating insights, and presenting results in a meaningful way.

# Project 2: "Breast Cancer Survival Analysis: Insights and Prediction"
Breast Cancer Survival Analysis and Prediction Project Overview
Objective:
This project aims to analyze breast cancer data to identify factors influencing patient survival rates, uncover trends, and provide actionable insights through data visualization and statistical analysis.

Dataset:
Source: METABRIC (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium) dataset.
Contains clinical and genomic data of breast cancer patients, including survival times, tumor characteristics, and treatment details.
Key Components:
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and ensured data consistency for robust analysis.
Conducted feature engineering to create new variables that provide deeper insights.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed survival trends based on patient age, tumor size, cancer stage, and hormone receptor status.
Explored the distribution of clinical outcomes (e.g., survival time, metastasis) and their correlation with various features.
Used statistical measures and visualizations (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots) to derive key insights.
Data Visualization:

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to present findings, including:
Survival rate trends across patient demographics.
Impact of tumor characteristics on survival outcomes.
Comparison of treatment effectiveness based on survival times.
Outcome and Insights:

Identified significant factors influencing breast cancer survival rates.
Highlighted key trends, such as:
Age groups with higher survival probabilities.
Tumor characteristics correlating with poor outcomes.
Importance of early detection and timely intervention.
Recommendations:

Suggested strategies for improving patient outcomes, such as focusing on early-stage diagnosis and targeted treatments.
Provided data-driven insights to guide healthcare professionals and policymakers.
Skills and Tools Used:
Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Data Analysis: Statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, correlation studies
Visualization: Power BI, Python visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Documentation: Clear explanation of methodology and findings
Impact:
This project demonstrates the potential of data analysis and visualization in understanding complex medical datasets, enabling informed decision-making for patient care and medical research.
